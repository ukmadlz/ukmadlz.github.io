      I founded <a href="http://hackference.co.uk" ><strong>//ackference</strong></a> in 2013 and it's been running every year ever since.
      I'm proud to say that it's a three-day event: a single day multitrack polyglot developer conference, followed by a weekend-long open hackathon.

    <p class="flow-text" >
      <a href="http://hackference.co.uk" ><strong>//ackference</strong></a> has always been run on the principle of  <strong>Learn, Build, Share</strong>, an ethos first developed by <a href="http://geeksoflondon.com/">Geeks of London</a> for <a href="http://hacked.io" >Hacked.io</a>, creating an environment in which young and senior developers alike can flourish and grow both their skills and knowledge.
