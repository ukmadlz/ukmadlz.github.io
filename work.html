      I also founded <a href="http://hackference.co.uk" ><strong>//ackference</strong></a> in 2013 and it's been running every year ever since.
      I'm proud to say that it's a three-day event, consisting of a single day multitrack polyglot developer conference and an open hackathon that takes place over the weekend.
      And the entire ethos of the event is built around <strong>"Learn, Build, Share"</strong> which was developed by the <a href="http://geeksoflondon.com/">Geeks of London</a> for <a href="http://hacked.io" >Hacked.io</a>.
