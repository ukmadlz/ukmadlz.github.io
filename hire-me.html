    I'm currently happy in my role as a Developer Advocate at IBM Watson Data Platform - I get to do cool things with outreach around cloud data, analytics, and offline first apps.
  </p>
  <p class="flow-text">
    I've been involved with software and web development since 2008, producing everything from websites and web apps to prototypes and SDKs.
    I work primarily in NodeJS and Javascript and with a combination of database technologies.
    I'm also well-versed in PHP development, especially the Laravel framework.
    I can also help with the use and creation of SaaS and PaaS systems, as well as with infrastructure and deployment.
  </p>
  <p class="flow-text">
    My tech community organising includes Hackference as well as many smaller community events around the UK.
    I'm an internationally-recognised technology speaker, presenting at events in the US and Europe (with Asia soon to follow) - you might want to check out some of my <a href="/speaking.html#past-talks">past</a> and <a href="/speaking.html#upcoming-talks">upcoming</a> appearances.
    I'm currently based in Birmingham, UK, and I'm currently not open to relocation.
    I'm very happy working on a remote friendly team as well as in an office environment.
