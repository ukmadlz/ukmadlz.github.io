    I'm currently happy in my role as a Developer Advocate at IBM Watson Data Platform, where I get to do cool things with outreach around cloud data, analytics, and offline first apps.
  </p>
  <p class="flow-text">
    My tech community organising includes Hackference and many smaller community events around the UK.
    I'm an internationally recognised technology speaker, speaking at events in the US and Europe (soon to be Asia).
    You might want to check out my <a href="/speaking.html#upcoming-talks">upcoming</a> and <a href="/speaking.html#past-talks">past</a> speaking appearances.
    I'm currently based in Birmingham, UK and would not be open to relocation, but very happy and accustomed to working on a remote friendly team.
  </p>
  <p class="flow-text">
    Get in touch at <a href="mailto:mike@elsmore.me">mike@elsmore.me</a> to start a conversation about working together. Even if something isn't a great fit for me right now, I'm always happy to see if it's a good fit for someone in my network!
